# AI Autopilot Microservice

## Overview
This project implements an agentic AI system that can process natural language IT requests, plan which specialized agents to run, execute them via LangGraph workflows, and return structured results. The system supports approval workflows and integrates advanced techniques like DSPy-based planning.

---

## Features
- FastAPI microservice with 4 endpoints
- LLM-powered agents:
  - **DSPyCoordinatorAgent** (plans steps dynamically)
  - **DiagnosticAgent** (identifies root cause and fixes)
  - **AutomationAgent** (generates and lints PowerShell/Bash scripts)
  - **WriterAgent** (generates summary, email, and SOP)
- LangGraph-based orchestration
- DSPy router component for dynamic planning
- Dummy finish node to ensure graceful termination

---

## API Endpoints
### `POST /api/v1/execute`
- Input: `{ prompt: str, require_approval: bool }`
- Behavior:
  - If `require_approval = true`, returns planned steps and status `waiting_approval`
  - If `false`, runs the full plan immediately

### `POST /api/v1/plans/:id/approve`
- Executes the planned steps

### `POST /api/v1/plans/:id/reject`
- Marks the plan as rejected

### `GET /api/v1/tasks/:id`
- Returns task status and results (if available)

## Advanced Techniques Used
- **DSPy Router Component**:
  - Replaces static rule-based planning with LLM-predicted step lists
  - Outputs e.g., `["diagnostic", "writer"]`

- **Context Pruning (manual MCP-style)**:
  - In `WriterAgent`, only essential diagnosis and script sections are passed
  - Reduces noise and token bloat
 
- **Note on MCP Server Integration**:
  - The project includes setup for the mcp server (Model Context Protocol dashboard/tracing framework), with components like FastMCP and Context imported.
  - However, it is not currently active in the main flow.
  - This is because the project already satisfies the context-pruning goal through manual trimming and structured context blocks in WriterAgent, making the full MCP dashboard integration unnecessary for the current scope.   

---

## Testing
Implemented with `pytest + httpx + langgraph`:
- `test_happy_path`
- `test_approval_flow`
- `test_agent_retry`
- `test_script_compiles`
- `test_task_status`

---

## Running the App
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes
- LLM: OpenAI (GPT-3.5-turbo)
- Optional: shellcheck/pwsh for linting
- Task plans and states are stored in an in-memory `TASK_STORE`

## Example Prompt
```json
{
  "prompt": "Diagnose why Windows Server 2019 VM cpu01 hits 95%+ CPU, generate a PowerShell script, and draft an email to management summarising findings.",
  "require_approval": false
}
```

##Example curl Commands
Use the following curl commands to test the API from the terminal:

###Run full execution immediately:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "prompt": "Diagnose why Windows Server 2019 VM cpu01 hits 95%+ CPU, generate a PowerShell script to collect perfmon logs, and draft an email to management summarising findings.",
        "require_approval": false
      }'
```

This sends a prompt to the server and immediately executes all relevant agents.

###Run with approval step first:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "prompt": "Create Azure CLI commands to lock RDP (3389) on my three production VMs to 10.0.0.0/24 and pause for approval before outputting the commands.",
        "require_approval": true
      }'
```

This starts the task but pauses until an explicit approval is submitted.

###Approve a plan (replace TASK_ID):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/plans/TASK_ID/approve
```

###Check task status (replace TASK_ID):

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tasks/TASK_ID
```

These commands help you simulate full workflow behavior, including approval logic and asynchronous status tracking.
